# Phishing-email Risk analyser
Overview:

This project is a python based tool designed to analyse the contents of an email and assess the likelyhood that it is a phishing attempt.

The program processes an emaik through multiple rule based checks, assigns a risk score based on detection indicators and classifies the emails as Low, Medium or High risk. it also provides practial guidance on how to handle suspicious emails.

The goal of this project is not to detect phishing emails perfectly, but to demonstrate foundational cybersecurity thinking, threat awareness and basic programing logic.
